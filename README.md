NLP Project: Twitter Sentiment & Language Trend Analysis

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow applied to Twitter sentiment data. Across four phases, it covers EDA & preprocessing, text classification strategies, sentiment analysis, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and advanced trend analysis. The work combines classical and modern NLP techniques, including TF-IDF, embeddings, lexicon-based sentiment models (VADER), machine learning classifiers, and topic modeling (LDA).

The final analysis highlights language trends, sentiment distribution, and evolving technology-related discussions using temporal analysis and visualization. This project not only showcases hands-on implementation but also provides insights applicable to business intelligence, social media analytics, and computational linguistics research.
